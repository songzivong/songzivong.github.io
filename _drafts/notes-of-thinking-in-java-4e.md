[*Thinking in Java*, 4th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0131872486) was written by [Bruce Eckel](https://www.bruceeckel.com/) and published in 2005. So the version of Java is limited to Java SE 6 and below. In the days (2019) I am reading this book, [Java 12](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/12-relnote-issues-5211422.html) has been published.

## The Style of This Book

Each chapter in this book tries to teach a single feature, or a small group of associated features, without relying on concepts that haven't been introduced yet. Because the author thought that if you teach a lot of new features to the audience would make them confused. Though, I don't think that bottom-up is not a perfect even possible way to introduce a programming language.

Anyway, these features are:

- Everything Is an Object
- Operators
- Controlling Execution
- Initiallization & Cleanup
- Access Control
- Reusing Classes
- Polymorphism
- Interfaces
- Inner Classes
- Holding Your Objects
- Error Handling with Exceptions
- Strings
- Type Information
- Generics
- Arrays
- Containers in Depth
- I/O
- Enumerated Types
- Annotations
- Concurrency
- GUI

### Examples

This book uses examples that are simple and short as possible ("toy examples"), and they are not "real world" problems.

> I’ve found that beginners are usually happier when they can understand every detail of an example rather than being impressed by the scope of the problem it solves. Also, there’s a severe limit to the amount of code that can be absorbed in a classroom situation.

However, I still prefer the real world examples. K&R C was written in that way.
