## Introduction to Objects 

> This chapter is background and supplementary material. Many people do not feel comfortable wading into object-oriented programming without understanding the big picture first. Thus, there are many concepts that are introduced here to give you a solid overview of OOP. However, other people may not get the big picture concepts until they’ve seen some of the mechanics first; these people may become bogged down and lost without some code to get their hands on. If you’re part of this latter group and are eager to get to the specifics of the language, feel free to jump past this chapter—skipping it at this point will not prevent you from writing programs or learning the language. However, you will want to come back here eventually to fill in your knowledge so you can understand why objects are important and how to design with them. 

Well, my reading strategy is taking a compromise method, i.e. after having read another chapter, going back to this chapter and read a few sections.

## Everything Is an Object

### You manipulate objects with references 

> Are you manipulating the element directly, or are you dealing with some kind of indirect representation (a pointer in C or C++) that must be treated with a special syntax? 

> All this is simplified in Java. You treat everything as an object, using a single consistent syntax. Although you treat everything as an object, the identifier you manipulate is actually a “reference” to an object.
